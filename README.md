# HarmonyExplorer

HarmonyExplorer is a full-stack web application that allows users to explore chord data using interactive visualizations. It uses data stored in a MongoDB database and fetches track metadata from the Jamendo API.


# Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)


# Installation Instructions

After unzipping the project folder, run the following command in the root directory to install all dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install both frontend and backend dependencies, including:

- express

Leave this running in one terminal.


# Start the Frontend

In another terminal, also from the root folder, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the React app on:  
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
